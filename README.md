# LandslidesSurvey

LandslidesSurvey is a *cross-platform mobile application* that allows users with any level of competence to **map
landslides** on the field in an easy and guided way.

All the collected data are stored in a database through a **publicly open API** that provides endpoints for retrieving,
inserting and modifying the landslides. 

### Features

- Secure authentication method through [Oauth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol.
- User's position always visible on a map.
- Possibility to insert new landslides in the system through a flow of questions (type of hazard, presence of
vegetation, monitoring systems in the area, picture of the landslide, etc.).
- Two different modes: *simple* and *expert*. Users with little to no geological background can use the simple mode to
answer fewer and less detailed questions, while expert mode allows a complete identification and description of the
phenomena.
- Possibility to update or delete mapped landslides.
- Application usable also offline with the possibility to temporarily save the data in the local storage and later sync
them with the main database.

#### Map screen

<img src="https://github.com/epessina/LandslidesSurvey/blob/master/App/screens/04-map.png" width="250" alt="Map screen">

1. **Map**. Centered on the user's position, it can be moved and zoomed freely.
2. **User marker**. Shows the current position of the user. It can be moved if the location is not accurate.
3. **Remote landslide marker**. Shows a mapped landslide that is saved remotely on the main database. A click
on one of those markers opens a screen that shows the information about the correspondent landslide and allows to delete
or modify it.
4. **Local landslide marker**. Works like the remote one but shows a landslide that is saved in the local database.
5. **Settings button**. Opens the application settings.
6. **Sync button**. Transfers on the main database all the landslides saved in the local one. 
7. **GPS button**. Centers the map and the user marker on the current location of the user.
8. **New landslide button**. Opens the screen that allows to insert a new landslide.
